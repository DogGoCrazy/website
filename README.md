# Website Scaffold

This is a minimal static website scaffold with HTML, CSS, and JS.

Files:
- `index.html` — main page
- `css/styles.css` — base styles
- `js/app.js` — small JS for theme toggle and helpers
- `assets/` — place static images or other assets here

How to use

Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click). For a local server (recommended), run:

```bash
# from /Users/ryanxia/website
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

Next steps
- Add images to `assets/`
- Add build tooling (parcel, vite) if you want a dev server and bundling
- Add tests or CI if you plan to deploy
